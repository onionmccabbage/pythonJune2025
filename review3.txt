Python Review 3 1hr 20 until 2:35
===============
- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Aim for good architecture (maybe use separate modules, remember 'if __name__...')
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
- There will be an opportunity to share your code

Write a 'Weather' class with get/set methods for:
  'city', 'temperature' and 'description'
(remember - you will also need __init__)

Your class should validate:
  - the value for 'city' is a non-empty string of three or more characters 
    (e.g. if type(city)== str and len(city)>2:)
  - if city is missing or unacceptable, you should provide a sensible default 
    (e.g. 'Genoa')
  - 'temperature' needs to be a numeric value between -70 and 90
  - 'description' must be a string, but is may be an empty string
  - decide if you will raise a TypeError or set a default for description and temperature 

If you like, in your Weather class override __str__ so the class prints nicely,
something like 'The weather in Athlone is cloudy at 12 degrees celcius'

Exercise the code by making an instance of your Weather class with suitable values

If Time
-------
Print the values from the weather instance to a text file 
You could include a timestamp in this text file (use datetime)
Also provide a mechanism to read back the weather reports from the text file

Optional
--------
Use the 'requests' library to get data from
  https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=athlone&units=metric&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
  (this ID will work up to 60 requests a minute)
  Replace Athlone with any city name
When the response comes back, populate an instance of your Weather class
For this API JSON data, the description will be
  response_dict['weather'][0]['description']
Write try-except blocks around some of your code (e.g. the api access)

Pass in the 'city' value as a parameter for the API URL
  f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&units=metric&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1'
The 'city' could be a sys.argv or user input value, but always provide a default

Use the returned data to populate values for temperature in your Weather instance
The temperature value will be
  response_dict['main']['temp'] (show other data if you wish)
