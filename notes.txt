Tuesday
> Welcome and intros
> where to write code: module (just a file) or immediate python
> architecture, structure, and professional code best practice
> print() and input()
> maths operators and data types
> indentation
> immutable strings
- lists and tuples (and memory efficiency)
> identifiers
> boolean True and False
> type and type conversion
> the if statement for conditional logic
> for, while, break and pass
> print formatting
> validate input (remember - all input is string)
> after lunch review exercise
> dictionaries (indexed iterable collections)
> import, libraries and modules
  to see what libraries are already installed: pip list
> functions
> packages (sinple a folder containing python files)

Wednesday
- how to access course recordings
- quick review of where we got to
q convert Py to executable
> if __name__ == '__main__'
- range, generators
- comprehensions
- to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python â€“m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
  or 
  - pip3 install requests
- using requests (to access web API via HTTP)
- strings with triple quotes
- exception handling (try-except etc.)
- debug tools   
- review exercise
- File input and output
- the nature of file access objects

Thursday
- in Python EVERTHING is an Object - every function, every class every module....
- any input or output is necessarily slow: I/O bound
- anything with __nnn__ is part of python (built in features) called 'dunder'
- functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
- PEP8 style guide https://pep8.org/
- custom generator and yield
- global and local scope 
- data modelling structures: 
    use built in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
- Objects and Classes (OOP)
  classes have properties (something belonging to the class) and methods (something the class can do)
- get/set as property decorators @property
- name mangling (__) and __slots__
- properties, methods, __str__
- inheritance
- review exercise
- end of course feedback
